        <h2>You Found Kevin's Public Data Blog!</h2>

        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/ninety-percent-iceberg-below-waterline">US Geological Survey</a>, only 10% of floating icy bodies are visible above the water, leaving 90% of their mass in some unknown configuration below the surface. On April 15, 1912, the world learned firsthand about the hidden dangers of icebergs - dangers which were amplified in that instance by unproven claims that the ship was unsinkable - when the HMS Titanic failed to avoid a large iceberg and subsequently sank in the North Atlantic ocean on the fourth day of her maiden voyage. This event, and others like it, inspired Reginald A. Fessenden to <a href="https://site.ieee.org/sb-uol/the-iceberg-detection-system-that-helped-ships-avoid-disaster/">develop an oscillator</a> in 1913 which allowed ships to detect and measure their distance to icebergs, significantly decreasing the likelihood of similar occurrences moving forward.</p>

        <p>Public data and icebergs have a lot in common. Although most public data remains hidden below the surface, members of the public can gain extraordinarily valuable insights into the size, scale, and condition of their public agencies via public data requests. Like Fessendon's oscillator, public data requests don't always yield high-resolution images of hidden dangers and activities, but they can be extraordinarily useful for identifying problems and for measuring the public's Return on Investment (ROI) of tax revenues.</p>

        <p>Although this blog will primarily rely on public data which is already available on the Internet, I'll also be covering the ins and outs of public data requests and methods available to members of the public who would like to increase the quality and usefulness of available data. In every case herein, the objective of these analyses is to provide intelligent insights that can - and hopefully will - lead to improved future outcomes across a wide range of fields and categories in public service.</p>

        <p>Stay tuned for interesting insights!</p>
